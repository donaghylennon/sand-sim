function that takes a position of a (falling) block, identifies
postions it could move into, and returns a pos or moves it into the 
best candidate empty > lower density

I'm probably going to need to use methods for the physics or something 
similar, because they will work differently for every single material,
maybe every material has different attributes?? and maybe functions 
are just fine

think ahead. what is the most flexible implementation that will be 
extensible to different materials, as well as optimisations/chunking/threading

also don't forget moving water more squares per tick, watch the vids if
you have to

(side idea: a mix of a powder game and an alchemy game could be pretty fun!)
